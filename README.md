# DeepLearning_Project_BorrowerClassification_TensorFlow

Project Overview
Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), build a model that can predict wether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan? This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan.

About The Dataset
The dataset is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club

Main techniques which used in this project:
  1. Seaborn data visualization.
  2. Multi-index dataframe processing.
  3. Correlation analysis.
  4. Feature engineering.
  5. TensorFlow classification model creation.
  6. Overfitting analysis.
  7. Early stop function.
  8. Classifier evaluation.
